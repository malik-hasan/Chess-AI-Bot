# Chess-AI-Bot
Created a high performing chess AI using the min-max algorithm in Python

Designed and implemented a Min-max algorithm which predicts the next best chess move. 
Algorithm chooses move which maximizes own score and minimizes opponents score by analyzing possible future moves upto a given depth.
Used the chess and chess.svg libraries to display the chess board and define basic chess methods.
